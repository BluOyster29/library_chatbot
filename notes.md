<Librarian> hello! what do you need help with?
<User> do you have when the world became figures, in 2016, by Olivier Rey?
<Librarian> hello to look
<User> thanks!
<Librarian> hello! No, unfortunately we do not have the book
<User> is it somewhere?
<User> translation of "quand le monde s'est fait nombre"
<Librarian> no it does not
<User> how is that possible?
<User> 2016 ISBN 978-2-234-07339-5
<Librarian> I have looked in the national catalog LIBRIS also can not find it there and not in our catalog, either, and you know that it has been translated from the French, we have not bought the French edition I have also looked at our suppliers and no one has in its catalog isbn is the French book
<User> see SVD today (lisa irenius) referer to densvenska translation. https://www.svd.se/darfor-ar-tyckarnas-kris-goda-nyheter can you get it?
<Librarian> unfortunately I did not get a hit on it in our national directory
<User> but it must surely be when a senior k8lturskribent refer to it? the ability to relate to - and accept - uncertainty has long been the exception in the public debate. French philosopher olivier rey have described how our time is almost obsessed with certainty in the form of statistics, percentages and other figures. His book "Quand le monde s'est fait nombre" (when the world became figures, 2016) is about how the preoccupation of numbers says as much about society as the figures themselves.
<User> perhaps is it in English?
<Librarian> as it may seem, she has only translated the French title in his article to refer to the French edition that came in 2016, but the way I'm looking at our suppliers or in Sweden's national directory so there is not. our our national directory, there are only two books of the faranske philosopher olivier rey these are une folle solitude and une question de taille
<User> thanks, I write to irenius and ask her directly.
